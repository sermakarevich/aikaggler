We thank Kaggle and the Vesuvius Challenge organizers for a fascinating competition.

Although majority of training pipeline was implemented outside the original nnUNet framework, most architectures are derived from work produced by MIC-DKFZ. We are grateful to them for advancing the 3D segmentation domain.

Below is an overview of our approach.

## 1st Stage — Initial Segmentation

We trained three independent models:

- **ResEnc-L UNet** (4 × TTA): The standard nnUNet-style residual encoder UNet with channels (32, 64, 128, 256, 320, 320) and `n_blocks=(1,3,4,6,6,6)`.
- **Primus-B**: A transformer based segmentation model from dynamic-network-architectures library of MIC-DKFZ.
- **Primus-B V2**: An improved variant of Primus-B.

Models were first pretrained on approximately 1,600 annotated images from other scrolls: https://dl.ash2txt.org/datasets/seg-derived-recto-surfaces/. Labels were slightly different but helped fine-tuning afterward to converge much faster. For example, Primus was taking 700 epochs or more to fully converge, and with pretraining it took 400.

All models were trained at patch size 160³, with AdamW (`lr=5e-5`, `wd=1e-4`) and mixed-precision training for approximately 400 epochs.

For losses, we used a combination of Dice Loss, Cross-Entropy Loss, Skeleton Recall Loss, and Surface Dice Loss (a modified version of clDice for 2D manifolds in 3D environments; implementation was for CryoET membranes). *(Note @sersasj: I had the opportunity to watch Lorenz Lamm's presentation at the CZII competition workshop, very nice to find a use almost a year later in a totally different task.)*

From local evaluation, the best models were  Primus-B V2, ResEnc-L and Primus-B respectively. We will add scores later. The good thing is that the models are very complementary to each other.

## 2nd Stage — Ensemble

The idea here was to let a model learn the complementarity between predictions. The model used a 4-channel input: [Image, ResEnc-L binary mask, Primus binary mask, PrimusV2 binary mask].

- **ResEnc-L UNet** ensembles initial stage predictions.

We trained with a random threshold on the fly ranging from 0.1 to 0.7, but used a threshold of 0.3 at inference.

## 3rd Stage — Refinement

*(Note @sersasj: I really liked the discussions about algorithms to fill holes, make the sheets more continuous, and so on. But I'm not clever enough to do this with an algorithm. So I did what I could: train a model to do that.)*

We used the same random threshold strategy on the fly. If the threshold is low, we hope the model learns to correct merging sheets, if it is high, we hope the model learns to correct broken sheets.
This behavior can be seen in the image below:

We also added a strong `randCoarseDropout` to mask the input to help model learn continuity and fix holes.

Input is [Mask, 2nd stage binary].

- ResEnc-L UNet refinement.

## 4th Stage — Refinement

Just another refinement network. Same idea of stage 3, help model learn to correct silly errors,

Input is [Mask, 3rd stage binary].

- ResEnc-L UNet — refinement.

## 5th Stage — Diffeomorphic Stage (biggest boost)

The diffeomorphic network takes the role of shape calibratin and thickness modification. This approach refers Tom’s paper (**Perceptual Contrastive Generative Adversarial Network based on image warping for unsupervised image-to-image translation**) and the **FlowNet2**. Unlike classic way like previous stage which just reproduces a better segmentation prediction, this network predicts the stationary velocity field which can manipulate the input mask previous stage it recieves. Intuitively, it is a vector field that determine how the mesh changes in 3d space, and we decide how many step it should move. 

### Core Designs and Intuition

This model is mainly based on Tom’s paper. It performs warping first and then refines the content afterward.

Diffeomorphic Step:

Using a lower threshold to generate the hard mask and applying uniform blur are two crucial steps for helping the model learn the SVF logits. Since the OOF mask is already strong, you need to intentionally introduce “errors” so the model can learn from them and be rewarded for correcting them.

- Using a small threshold reveals more suppressed predictions. Some of these predictions contribute to thicker mask regions, which allows the model to identify and fix such issues.
- A hard mask alone cannot provide useful gradients to the model. We also found that warping a blurred mask is very beneficial for improving topology and boosting VOI performance.

Blurring Example
![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F4310004%2F6ca13dd6aa7ec55274b64e0193386444%2Ff1.png?generation=1772451933189014&alt=media)


```
# ----------------------------------------
# 1. Blur the input mask
# ----------------------------------------
Hard_Mask = Soft_Mask>0.3

Blurred_mask = Gaussian_Blur(Hard_Mask, kernel_size=3, sigma=5)
# (Produces soft mask M in [0,1])

# ----------------------------------------
# 2. Predict stationary velocity field
# ----------------------------------------

gamma = Diffeomorphic_Prediction(Blurred_mask)
# gamma ∈ R^{3×D×H×W}  (SVF logits)

v = tanh(gamma) * max_v
# v : Ω → R³
# bounded stationary velocity field

# ----------------------------------------
# 3. Scaling & Squaring (Lie exponential)
# ----------------------------------------

# Initialize small deformation
phi_0 = v / (2^N)

phi = phi_0

Repeat N times:

    # Compose deformation with itself
    # (φ ∘ φ)(x) = φ(x + φ(x))
    
    phi = phi + Warp(phi, phi)

# After N steps:
# phi ≈ exp(v)

# ----------------------------------------
# 4. Warp mask with diffeomorphic transform
# ----------------------------------------

Warped_mask(x) = Blurred_mask(x + phi(x))

```


Signed Distance Topology Shift Prediction:

Optical flow–based methods usually suffer from a “folding” issue. This occurs when the model makes abrupt deformations, which significantly damage the topology. Tom struggled with this problem for quite some time. He eventually addressed it by introducing an additional output channel that predicts the “shift” in the SDF space of the warped mask.

```
# ----------------------------------------
# Topology-aware correction
# ----------------------------------------

# Convert to soft signed distance
SDF = log(Warped_mask + ε) - log(1 - Warped_mask + ε)

# Learn correction field from 4th channel r_t
t      = sigmoid(r_t)                 # gating map
delta  = max_offset * tanh(r_t)       # signed bounded offset

SDF_corrected = SDF + t * delta

Final_mask = sigmoid(SDF_corrected)
```

Loss functions for warping

- Minimizing SVF Smoothing to avoid folding by surpressing the magnitutes of velocities

```python
def svf_smoothness(self, v):
    dz = (v[:, :, 1:] - v[:, :, :-1]).pow(2).mean()
    dy = (v[:, :, :, 1:] - v[:, :, :, :-1]).pow(2).pow(1).mean()
    dx = (v[:, :, :, :, 1:] - v[:, :, :, :, :-1]).pow(2).mean()

    return (dz + dy + dx) / 3.0
```

- Minimizing jacobian log barrier to keep flow active and preventing a compressible elastic material that strongly resists collapsing or flipping

```python
def jacobian_determinant(flow):
    """
    flow: (B, 3, D, H, W) displacement field u(x)
    returns: (B, D, H, W) jacobian determinant of φ(x)=x+u(x)
    """
    B, C, D, H, W = flow.shape
    assert C == 3

    # gradients wrt spatial axes (z = depth, y = height, x = width)
    du_dx = torch.gradient(flow, dim=4)[0]  # width axis
    du_dy = torch.gradient(flow, dim=3)[0]  # height axis
    du_dz = torch.gradient(flow, dim=2)[0]  # depth axis

    # components
    ux_x = du_dx[:,0]; ux_y = du_dy[:,0]; ux_z = du_dz[:,0]
    uy_x = du_dx[:,1]; uy_y = du_dy[:,1]; uy_z = du_dz[:,1]
    uz_x = du_dx[:,2]; uz_y = du_dy[:,2]; uz_z = du_dz[:,2]

    # deformation gradient J = I + ∇u
    j11 = 1 + ux_x; j12 =     ux_y; j13 =     ux_z
    j21 =     uy_x; j22 = 1 + uy_y; j23 =     uy_z
    j31 =     uz_x; j32 =     uz_y; j33 = 1 + uz_z

    det = (
        j11 * (j22 * j33 - j23 * j32)
        - j12 * (j21 * j33 - j23 * j31)
        + j13 * (j21 * j32 - j22 * j31)
    )
    return det
    
def jacobian_log_barrier(flow, eps=1e-6):
    det = jacobian_determinant(flow)
    det_clamped = torch.clamp(det, min=eps)
    loss = -torch.log(det_clamped).mean()
    return loss
```

Loss function for SDF topology fixing 

The challenge @Tom faces is avoiding the forth channel cheating and dominating the prediction, which letting the diffeomorphic step useless. We use three loss functions to solve this issue.

- Sparisty loss: Keep sparse topology correction, discouraged from editing everywhere and only activates correction when necessary

```python
#suppose t = gating map in topoFix
def topo_sparsity(self, t):
		return t.mean()
```

- Total variation loss: Making topology edits to be region-based, not noisy voxel-wise toggles

```python
def topo_tv(self, t):
    dz = (t[:, :, 1:] - t[:, :, :-1]).abs().mean()
    dy = (t[:, :, :, 1:] - t[:, :, :, :-1]).abs().mean()
    dx = (t[:, :, :, :, 1:] - t[:, :, :, :, :-1]).abs().mean()

    return (dz + dy + dx) / 3.0
```

- Boundary loss: Encourage edits near zero-level set and only modify topology near the object surface
```python
def topo_boundary(self, t, sdf):
    boundary = torch.exp(-sdf.abs())
    return (t * (1.0 - boundary)).mean()
```


### Variations of Implementations

We have two implementation of Diffeomorphic Network, one is in @Tom repositery and another is @Sergio repositery, they have different augmentation, processing and loss functions. All the network architecture are all identical, using the nnUNet-style residual encoder UNet but outputs with 4 channels. 

* Loss differneces

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Comparing different diffeomorphic setup

Before the deadline, we conducted simulation trials to approximate the public subset (40 samples per subset, 200 trials) and compared the diffeomorphic networks from the repo of @Tom and @Sergio.

As shown in the plot, there is a clear difference in metric preference between the two approaches. @Tom’s model outperforms @Sergio’s on Surface Dice, while @Sergio’s setup achieves better results on Topology and VOI scores. In most cases, @Sergio’s configuration achieves the best overall performance.

However, we also observed that in a few subsets, @Tom’s overall score is higher, which is consistent with its LB. This suggests that the public subset may resemble those specific subsets where @Tom’s model performs better, and a small number of samples could have disproportionately boosted the public score, essentially a favorable sampling effect.

* Validation results

|  | CV | LB | PB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tom | 0.619 | 0.595 | 0.612 |
| Tom + Sergio | 0.621 | 0.588 | 0.615 |

* Hypothesis testing (H0: @Tom = @Sergio, H1: @Tom > @Sergio )

| Metric | Mean Difference | T-Statistic | P-Value | Reject? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Surface_dice | +0.0086 | 74.97 | <0.0001 | Y |
| Score | -0.0017 | -7.64 | 1 | N |
| Topo | -0.0124 | -20.11 | 1 | N |
| Voi | -0.004 | -117.68 | 1 | N |

* Based on the hypothesis testing, these two methods may not have a significant difference in topology or VOI score on the public subset. In that case, the method with the higher surface Dice score dominates, resulting in a 0.007 boost on the leaderboard. The other one we hoped improving lb experiences a substantial drop, scoring 0.588, which does bad in surface dice.
