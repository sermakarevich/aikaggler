Thank you for hosting such an interesting competition. 
The scores around my position were very close, so everyone had a chance to win Gold.
Luckily, I ended up in the prize range.

# Overview
- Solution completely relies on train-on-test approach.
- safety content moderation pretrained models boost ensemble score.


# Data Preprocess
Since the host indicated that subreddit was not involved in the annotation process, it was completely ignored.

I removed all duplicates using `rule-body-label` as the unique key. 
This significantly reduced training time. Also, not considering subreddit at all resulted in better scores (+0.007).

When taking unique values by `rule-body-label`, we can see that labels are inconsistent. 
I replaced the labels with the most frequent ones for training stability.
Keeping entries where majority voting was not possible (ties) slightly decreased the score, so I discarded them.

This process was performed on the combined train and test data. 

# CV
I built a CV using the train set with `unique rule-body-label` combinations, but there was no correlation with LB at all. 
It was mainly used to verify that the models could be used correctly. 
I completely trusted the LB due to the large amount of test data.

# Models
| model | public | private |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Qwen3-14B | 0.926 | 0.919
| phi-4 | 0.924 | 0.920
| gemma-2-9b-it | 0.924 | 0.920
| shieldgemma-9b | **0.927** | **0.922**
| Qwen3-8B-Guard | 0.923 | 0.921



I swept models around 8B-14B size that could run on T4 (16GB VRAM) with QLoRA. 
Unfortunately, there were very few models that could exceed the 0.920 threshold.

Adding gemma2-9b-it to the ensemble greatly boosted the score. 
shieldgemma as a variant brought the best performance, and single best, surpassing Qwen3-14B. 
Related to this, Qwen3-8B-Guard also performed better than the vanilla model (0.920 -> 0.923).

Models are trained using the Unsloth framework, with two models trained simultaneously by specifying different GPU IDs. 
I explored training 32B with QLoRA + DDP, but couldn't implement it due to complexity requirements.

Training and inference time combined was approximately 10 hours for the four models. 
The fifth model, Qwen3-8B-Guard, was only used to infer two rules.

# Unlock Gemma2 on vLLM
I think this is probably the most unique aspect of my solution. 
vLLM doesn't allow inferring Gemma2 in fp16 due to numerical instability. 
However, since this is simply hardcoded, it's easy to unlock by rewriting with sed. 

```bash
sed -i '/^_FLOAT16_NOT_SUPPORTED_MODELS = {$/,/^}$/c\
_FLOAT16_NOT_SUPPORTED_MODELS = {}' /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/vllm/config.py
```
(vllm==0.10.0)

Even after unlocking, I was able to achieve the above reasonable scores.
(probably due to the special requirement of inferring only 1 token)

# Didn't Work
- Inferring only public rules with Qwen3-32B
Based on my understanding of the metrics and experiments, ranking predictions per rule doesn't affect the score. 
So I tried inferring only public rules with a 32B model trained on train data, but the score was significantly worse compared to ensembles of other models. 
Is it because the prediction distribution differs from models trained with train-on-test?

- Synthetic Data
Adding synthetic data worsened the score, so I discarded the idea early on. 
Considering that the loss for synthetic data approached zero during training, I think it failed to emulate the test distribution.
