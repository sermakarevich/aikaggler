# Searching the Amazon with Remote Sensing 🛰️ and AI 🤖

Remote sensing allows us to collect data about the world from a distance. This is especially useful in large, sparsely populated and hard to traverse areas like the Amazon, where due to it's vast size and difficult terrain, searches by land are impractical.  

In my approach I want to combine cutting edge remote sensing techniques with cutting edge AI models in order to search for possible locations where as-yet undiscovered remnants of pre-columbian civilizations might lie.  

The first step is to search through a set of Sentinel-2 imagery that covers the entire Amazon region. The 12-band Sentinel-2 data covering the Amazon would amount to a dataset a little over a TB, which is a bit too much to easily handle. However, we can make this a little bit easier on oursevles by rather searching through embeddings. These embeddings were creating by running them through a pre-trained encoder and saving the embeddings, giving us the possibility to take advantage of a capable encoder without actually having to spend the compute nor make provisions for the storage, which is beyond what is practical in a Kaggle notebook. I trained a small model on the embeddings using the locations of known geoglyphs to predict plausible locations of possible earthworks. 

Next I compare the locations of possible earthworks with that of available Lidar data, and search through the most relevant Lidar derived elevation models for signatures of ancient human activity using the OpenAI API, and calling one of OpenAI's more recent models to interpret the Lidar derived images.  

Finally, I again use OpenAI's API to call a model to critically evaluate my approach so far and to suggest future improvments that could by applied. This way the notebook can be recursively updated with suggestions from the model. 

## Preliminary work

This is the third in a series of notebooks of mine, and it builds on the work done in the other two: 
* The [first notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/fnands/major-tom-embedding-filter) filters down the ~250 GB of Major TOM embeddings data to only the 12 GB that overlaps with the Amazon biome.  
* The [second notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/fnands/major-tom-embedding-filter), takes these embeddings as well as the location of known geoglyphs to predict possible locations for new geoglyphs based on the similarity of the embedding locations to those of known geoglyphs.   


In this notebook, we will build on that work to find plausible new locations where earthworks might be discovered in the Amazon, and assess their credibility with the help of OpenAI's most recent models. 


## Data sources used

* The Lidar data used is taken from NASA's [LiDAR Surveys over Selected Forest Research Sites, Brazilian Amazon, 2008-2018](https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1644)

```python
!pip install contextily
```

## Data used in Map form

Let's have a look at the current state of things. 

Below we can see the location of known sites, predicted sites, and the areas over which Lidar scans have been performed:

```python
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import contextily as ctx
from matplotlib.patches import Patch
from matplotlib.lines import Line2D
from kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient

# Load your GeoJSON files
known_sites = gpd.read_file("/kaggle/input/archaeoblog-amazon-geoglyphs/geoglyph_points.geojson")
predicted_sites = gpd.read_file("/kaggle/input/major-tom-embedding-search/top_500_similar.geojson")

# Load boundary data (e.g., Amazon biome, country outlines, etc.)
boundaries = gpd.read_file("/kaggle/input/geographical-boundaries-of-amazonia-by-eva-et-al/amazonia_polygons.shp")

# Load Lidar locations
lidar = gpd.read_file("/kaggle/input/nasa-amazon-lidar-2008-2018/cms_brazil_lidar_tile_inventory.geojson")

# Reproject both to Web Mercator for contextily
known_sites = known_sites.to_crs(epsg=3857)
predicted_sites = predicted_sites.to_crs(epsg=3857)
boundaries = boundaries.to_crs(epsg=3857)
lidar = lidar.to_crs(epsg=3857)

# Plot the map with contextily basemap
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 10))

# Plot boundary layer (e.g., Amazon region or political boundaries)
boundaries.plot(ax=ax, facecolor='none', edgecolor='purple', linewidth=2, label="Amazon Boundary")

# Plot your points/polygons
known_sites.plot(ax=ax, color='black', markersize=10, alpha=0.7, label="Known Pre-Columbian Sites")
predicted_sites.plot(ax=ax, color='blue', markersize=10, alpha=0.7, label="Predicted Pre-Columbian Sites")

# Plot Lidar locations
lidar.plot(ax=ax, color='red',  edgecolor='red', alpha=1.0, linewidth=2, label="NASA Lidar Locations")

# Add a basemap
ctx.add_basemap(ax, source=ctx.providers.OpenStreetMap.Mapnik)

# Create custom legend
legend_elements = [
    Line2D([0], [0], marker='o', color='w', label='Known Pre-Columbian Sites',
           markerfacecolor='black', markersize=8),
    Line2D([0], [0], marker='o', color='w', label='Predicted Pre-Columbian Sites',
           markerfacecolor='blue', markersize=8),
    Patch(facecolor='none', edgecolor='purple', label='Amazon Boundary'),
    Patch(facecolor='none', edgecolor='red', label='NASA Lidar Locations')

]

ax.legend(handles=legend_elements, loc='upper right')

# Clean up
ax.set_axis_off()
plt.title("Pre-Columbian Sites in the Amazon Basin", fontsize=14)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Search for relevant Lidar sites

Now we search for areas that have been scanned by high resolution aerial Lidar that fall close to predicted Pre-Columbian sites. If the results from the embeddings search have found valid locations, it is likely that these Lidar scans might have scanned a relevant archeological site, and we can narrow down the data we have to parse from thousands of possible images to just a handful of likely cases.

```python
# Step 2: Buffer lidar geometries by 5000 meters (5 km)
lidar_buffered = lidar.copy()
lidar_buffered["geometry"] = lidar_buffered.geometry.buffer(5000)

# Step 3: Spatial join — points within buffer
nearby_sites = gpd.sjoin(predicted_sites, lidar_buffered, how="inner", predicate="within")

# Step 4: Optionally drop duplicates or extra columns
nearby_sites = nearby_sites.drop(columns=['index_right'])

nearby_sites.head()
```

Let's see where our candidate sites are:

```python
nearby_sites = nearby_sites.to_crs(epsg=3857)
# Plot the map with contextily basemap
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 10))

# Plot boundary layer (e.g., Amazon region or political boundaries)
boundaries.plot(ax=ax, facecolor='none', edgecolor='purple', linewidth=2, label="Amazon Boundary")

# Plot your points/polygons
nearby_sites.plot(ax=ax, color='red', markersize=10, alpha=0.7, label="Candidate Sites")

# Add a basemap
ctx.add_basemap(ax, source=ctx.providers.OpenStreetMap.Mapnik)

# Create custom legend
legend_elements = [
    Line2D([0], [0], marker='o', color='w', label='Candidate Sites',
           markerfacecolor='red', markersize=8),
    Patch(facecolor='none', edgecolor='purple', label='Amazon Boundary'),

]

ax.legend(handles=legend_elements, loc='upper right')

# Clean up
ax.set_axis_off()
plt.title("Candidate Sites in the Amazon Basin", fontsize=14)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Hillshade and false colour DTM

For the Lidar tiles, I have processed NASA's [LiDAR Surveys over Selected Forest Research Sites, Brazilian Amazon, 2008-2018](https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1644) dataset into a collection of 1 meter ground sampling distance (GSD) digital terrain models (DTMs). You can find the processed dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fnands/nasa-amazon-lidar-2008-2018/).   


DTMs are a bit hard to interpret by eye, so we will process the data into a false colour image, and a hillshade image. 

Hillshade images make it easier to pick out subtle changes from elevation model, and are often used when looking for patterns like raised surfaces in elevation models. 

Let's define the needed functions, and plot an example DTM below:

```python
# Some inspiration taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/code/llkh0a/simple-dem-data-gpt-4o-mini-image-prompt
import io
import base64
import rasterio
import numpy as np
import os

# Base path to DTM files
base_dtm_path = '/kaggle/input/nasa-amazon-lidar-2008-2018/Nasa_lidar_2008_to_2018_DTMs/DTM_tiles'


# Taken from https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/create-hillshade-py
# Hillshade calculation
def hillshade(array, azimuth, angle_altitude):
    azimuth = 360.0 - azimuth
    x, y = np.gradient(array)
    slope = np.pi / 2. - np.arctan(np.sqrt(x*x + y*y))
    aspect = np.arctan2(-x, y)
    azm_rad = azimuth * np.pi / 180.
    alt_rad = angle_altitude * np.pi / 180.
    shaded = np.sin(alt_rad) * np.sin(slope) + np.cos(alt_rad) * np.cos(slope) * np.cos((azm_rad - np.pi/2.) - aspect)
    return 255 * (shaded + 1) / 2

# Helper to plot and encode to JPEG base64
def encode_image(array, cmap='terrain', vmin=None, vmax=None):
    clean_arr = np.nan_to_num(array, nan=-1)
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.imshow(clean_arr, cmap=cmap, vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax)
    plt.axis('off')
    plt.tight_layout()
    
    buf = io.BytesIO()
    plt.savefig(buf, format='jpeg', bbox_inches='tight', dpi=150)
    plt.close()
    buf.seek(0)
    return base64.b64encode(buf.getvalue()).decode('utf-8')

# Main processing function
def process_lidar_tile(laz_filename):
    tif_filename = laz_filename.replace('.laz', '.tif')
    tif_path = os.path.join(base_dtm_path, tif_filename)

    with rasterio.open(tif_path) as src:
        dem = src.read(1)
        dem = np.where(dem == src.nodata, np.nan, dem)

    # Normalize DEM for color image
    vmin = np.nanpercentile(dem, 2)
    vmax = np.nanpercentile(dem, 98)
    dem_base64 = encode_image(dem, cmap='terrain', vmin=vmin, vmax=vmax)

    # Generate hillshade from filled DEM
    dem_filled = np.nan_to_num(dem, nan=np.nanmean(dem))
    hs = hillshade(dem_filled, azimuth=315, angle_altitude=45)
    hillshade_base64 = encode_image(hs, cmap='gray')

    return dem_base64, hillshade_base64


# Process the first tile as an example
dem_b64, hillshade_b64 = process_lidar_tile(nearby_sites['Name'].values[0])

# Optional: Display inline in notebook
from IPython.display import HTML

```

## Using an OpenAI LLM to interpret the Lidar derived imagery

Now we have a handful of locations that might be of interest. We could step through them one-by-one, but once this dataset becomes too large this becomes impractical for a human to do. 

We will automate the analysis of our derived images by calling the OpenAI API, and having one of their models do the work for us!

We ask the model to predict if there is some evidence of human activity, and to rate the location on a scale of 0 to 100:

```python
from openai import OpenAI
import json

# Fetch my OpenAI API key which has been stored as a Kaggle secret. 
user_secrets = UserSecretsClient()
OPENAI_KEY = user_secrets.get_secret("OPENAI_KEY")
```

```python
client = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_KEY)
#CHOSEN_MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini"
CHOSEN_MODEL = "o3"


prompt = """

You are an expert in archaeology and remote sensing with a focus on identifying traces of ancient civilizations in elevation and terrain data.

You are being shown a hillshade image derived from LIDAR elevation data, as well as the DTM that the hillshade was derived from. 
The hillshade image emphasizes terrain features using simulated lighting and is intended to reveal subtle surface anomalies such as raised mounds, geometric depressions, terracing, causeways, or other patterns that may not be visible in standard imagery.

Your task:
Evaluate the hillshade image and DTM for **possible indicators of pre-Columbian human activity**, particularly features that may suggest the presence of:
- Ancient ruins (e.g., raised platforms, stone walls)
- Anthropogenic earthworks (e.g., mounds, canals, roads, plazas)
- Agricultural or settlement structures (e.g., terraces, rectangular clearings)

Be especially sensitive to **subtle geometric or organized features** that would be unlikely to occur from natural geomorphological processes alone.

Please be aware that the image might be buffered with NODATA at the edges. The most likely case is that there is no evidence of human activity.  

Return a JSON response like:

{
  "description": "Brief notes on visible features",
  "human_activity": "yes" or "no",
  "confidence": score from 0 to 100
}

Focus on signs like raised platforms, unnatural geometric shapes, mounds, or patterns consistent with ruins or agricultural modification.

Please do not add backticks around the json. The response will loaded in python with json.loads(), so please format accordingly. 

"""

results = []
for _, row in nearby_sites.head().iterrows():

    lidar_filename = row['Name']
    dem_b64, hillshade_b64 = process_lidar_tile(lidar_filename)
    
    
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=CHOSEN_MODEL,
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": prompt},
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [

                ]
            }
        ]
    )

    
    results.append((lidar_filename, json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content), dem_b64, hillshade_b64))
```

Once this is done, we can look at the site that the model has ranked as the most likely, and evaluate the images ourselves to see if we agree with the model's assessment:

```python
# Filter only those with likely human activity
filtered = [entry for entry in results if entry[1]['human_activity'] == 'yes']

# Fallback in case no human activity is found
if len(filtered) == 0:
    filtered = results

# Sort by confidence (highest first)
ranked = sorted(filtered, key=lambda x: x[1]['confidence'], reverse=True)

# Get top-ranked result(s)
top_confidence = ranked[0][1]['confidence']
top_results = [r for r in ranked if r[1]['confidence'] == top_confidence]

# Display
filename, data, dem_b64, hillshade_b64 =  top_results[0]
print(f"\nTop result: {filename}")
print(f"Confidence: {data['confidence']}")
print(f"Human Activity Likely: {data['human_activity']}")
print(f"Description: {data['description']}")

HTML(f"""
<h3>DTM (Terrain Color)</h3>
<img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,{dem_b64}"/>
<h3>Hillshade</h3>
<img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,{hillshade_b64}"/>
""")
```

## Evaluate our approach


This approach is still a work in progress, and can likely be improved a bit. But how can we get ideas for direction of future improvements? 

If only there was a large model trained on a large amount of data that likely includes a large amount of archeological reports and academic papers that could hel us generate ideas...

Oh wait! 

First we dump our notebook into a `.ipynb` file, and then convert it into a markdown file, stripping out the images to save space:

```python
import kaggle_session

client = kaggle_session.UserSessionClient()
notebook = client.get_exportable_ipynb()['source']

with open("kaggle.ipynb", "w") as f:
    f.write(notebook)
```

```python
!jupyter nbconvert --ClearOutputPreprocessor.enabled=True --to markdown kaggle.ipynb
```

Now we can pass out notebook to an OpenAI model, and have it evaluate our approach so far, and have it suggest further improvements that we can apply in a future version of this notebook. We can then recursively update this notebook and improve it over time with suggestions from the OpenAI model.

```python
with open("kaggle.md", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    notebook_text = f.read()
```

```python
prompt = """

## Conlcusions

In this notebook we have taken model predictions based on Sentinel-2 image predictions of where possible geoglyphs in the Amazon might exist. This was cross-referenced with the locations of known Lidar scans in the Amazon, and the Lidar scans that are the closest to our predicted locations were passed to an OpenAI model for evaluation. Finally, we asked the OpenAI model to critique our approach for future improvements.
