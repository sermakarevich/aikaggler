```python
# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session
```

## Added more features and EDA based on comments recieved!! TY!!

### I love Football and Engineering :-)

Here is a summary of features I engineered! Please upvote if you find it useful. All suggestions welcome. 
***The complete code is available to run as is!!***

### 1. Player Characteristics Features
***Position/Role Encoding:*** Different positions have fundamentally different movement patterns. Example: WRs run complex routes, OLs move linearly, QBs drop back

***Physical Attributes:*** Size and weight affect acceleration, agility, and role Example: Larger players (OL/DL) have different movement capabilities than smaller players (WR/DB)

***Experience/Team:*** More experienced players might make smarter decisions

***Football Intelligence:***
- A WR running a "go" route vs a CB in "man coverage" have predictable interaction patterns

- Passer vs Targeted Receiver vs Other Route Runner have completely different objectives

### 2. Movement & Physics-Based Features

***Critical Movement Metrics***

     - Speed (s): Current velocity magnitude
     - Acceleration (a): Rate of speed change - indicates cuts/stops/starts
     - Orientation (o): Which way player is facing
     - Direction (dir): Actual movement direction

***Advanced Physics Features***

     - Velocity components - Breakdown movement vectors ( helps models understand movement in field coordinates) 
     - Trignometric encoding (prevents 0° vs 360° discontinuity issues)

### 3. Play Context Features - Most Important

These features are Game Changing!!!

***Ball Landing position***

        - The spot tells you where the play is designed to go
        - Receivers will adjust routes towards the ball
        - Defenders will react to the ball location
        - Distance to ball predicts engagement likelihoo

***Field Position Intelligence***

        - Red Zone (inside 20) - Compressed field, different route concepts
        - Mid-Field: more vertical routes
        - Backed-up: conservative play calling 

### 4.  Relative Features (Player Interactions)

***Defensive Pressure Metrics***

        - Receiver separation: Critical for completion probability
        - Pass rush pressure: Affects QB movement and timing
        - Zone coverage voids: Areas where receivers can find space

Football is a game of spatial relationships. Leverage (inside/outside positioning) determines route success. Cushion (DB-WR distance) affects route development

### 5. Advanced Football Intelligence

***Route & Coverage Concepts***

      **Role Based Behavior**
      
          - Targeted Receiver: Primary read, most likely to adjust route
          - Other Route Runners: Clear out defenders, run decoy routes
          - Passer: Follow-through, scramble, or avoid pressure
          - Defensive Coverage: Maintain leverage, react to receivers

    
     **Field Awareness**

          - Sideline: Acts as extra defender, limits route options
          - End zone: Compresses field, affects route depth

    **Formation Intelligence**

          - Spread formation: More vertical routes, wider spacing
          - Bunched formation: Pick plays, crossing routes
          - Empty backfield: Passing tendency

### 6. Temoral Features

***Movement History***

    - Acceleration trends - Is player speeding up/slowing down?
    - Direction changes: Route breaks, cuts, adjustments
    - Historical positions: Route running patterns
