# Mash It Up!

![image.png](attachment:3e34ed3c-a7b6-4143-9572-6c44294baad1.png)

This notebook combines ideas from of my other Phi 3.5-based notebooks:

https://www.kaggle.com/code/richolson/add-it-up (as modified in ["two judge version"](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kawchar85/13-003-lb-add-it-up-for-two-judge))  
https://www.kaggle.com/code/richolson/what-s-your-cut-off-date-asking-for-a-friend  
https://www.kaggle.com/code/richolson/phi-the-spicy-contrarian-few-shot  

We use a variety of example messages and prompts - selected with chosen probabilities!

For the add-it-up attack - we can now dynamically specify which LLM we call out (Gemma, Qwen, etc).  

This notebook also supports adding static strings ("Post-Processing") to essays at chosen probabilities.

This all lets us easily add variety to our attacks.  Hopefully better targetting different LLMs, improving vertical variance and reducing repetition penalty.

I'm always running experiments - **see the cells below for this notebook's configuration...**

**Define Essay Mash-up**: What mix of prompts / examples are used  
**Inference Demo**: Example of LLM output  
**Define Post-Processing Mix**: Defines what static attack features are added **(if enabled...)**
