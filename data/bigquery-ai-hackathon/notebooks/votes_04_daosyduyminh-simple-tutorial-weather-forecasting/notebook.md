# **Tutorial: Weather Forecasting with BigQuery, Prophet & BigQuery AI.FORECAST**


Forecasting weather is a great way to combine **data engineering** and **data science** skills.
In this tutorial, we will explore **three different approaches** to forecasting temperature in **Hanoi** using Google BigQuery’s **NOAA GSOD** dataset:



### **1. Pure Python + Prophet**

* Download raw weather data from BigQuery Public Datasets.
* Clean and interpolate missing values.
* Train a **Prophet** forecasting model locally in Python.
* Predict the next 30 days of temperatures.


### **2. BigQuery ML (`CREATE MODEL`)**

* Stay entirely in **SQL** – no downloading data for training.
* Use **BigQuery ML** to train a regression model directly in the data warehouse.
* Evaluate model performance and run predictions using SQL queries.


### **3. BigQuery Generative AI (`AI.FORECAST`)**

* Use **Google Cloud’s AI.FORECAST** function for server-side time-series forecasting.
* No manual feature engineering or model tuning – just provide your dataset and forecast horizon.
* Ideal for **fast prototyping** and large datasets.


## **Prerequisites**

* **Google Cloud** account with BigQuery enabled.
* Python environment with:

```bash
pip install google-cloud-bigquery pandas prophet matplotlib
```

* *(Optional)* Kaggle Notebook with BigQuery integration enabled.

### **1. Pure Python + Prophet**

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery
import pandas as pd
from prophet import Prophet
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create BigQuery client
client = bigquery.Client()

# Query weather data for Hanoi
QUERY_WEATHER = """
SELECT
  DATE(CAST(year AS INT64), CAST(mo AS INT64), CAST(da AS INT64)) AS ds,
  temp AS y
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*`
WHERE stn = '488200'
  AND _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '2020' AND '2022'
  AND temp IS NOT NULL AND temp != 9999.9
ORDER BY ds
"""

# ✅ Avoid Kaggle PermissionDenied by disabling BigQuery Storage API
raw = client.query(QUERY_WEATHER).to_dataframe(create_bqstorage_client=False)
print(f"✅ Retrieved {len(raw)} weather records")

# Ensure ds is datetime
raw["ds"] = pd.to_datetime(raw["ds"])

# Create a continuous date range covering the dataset
full_idx = pd.date_range(raw["ds"].min(), raw["ds"].max(), freq="D")

# Merge with the full date index
raw = pd.DataFrame({"ds": full_idx}).merge(raw, on="ds", how="left")

# Interpolate only the numeric 'y' column using time-based interpolation
raw = raw.set_index("ds")
raw["y"] = raw["y"].interpolate(method="time")
raw = raw.reset_index()

# ✅ Fit Prophet model
m = Prophet(daily_seasonality=True, yearly_seasonality=True)
m.fit(raw)

# Forecast next 30 days
future = m.make_future_dataframe(periods=30)
forecast = m.predict(future)

# Display last 10 forecasted days
print(forecast[["ds", "yhat", "yhat_lower", "yhat_upper"]].tail(10))

# Plot forecast
m.plot(forecast)
plt.title("Hanoi Temperature Forecast")
plt.show()

# Optional: Plot forecast components
m.plot_components(forecast)
plt.show()
```

### **2. BigQuery ML (`CREATE MODEL`)**

* Stay entirely in **SQL** – no downloading data for training.
* Use **BigQuery ML** to train a regression model directly in the data warehouse.
* Evaluate model performance and run predictions using SQL queries.

### **1. Setup BigQuery Client**

```python
# !pip install google-cloud-bigquery

from google.cloud import bigquery
import pandas as pd
import os

# Authenticate via service account JSON
os.environ["GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"] = "path/to/your-service-account.json"
client = bigquery.Client()
```

### **2. Create a Dataset in Your Project**

```python
# Replace `my_dataset` with your dataset name
dataset_id = f"{client.project}.weather_ml"
dataset = bigquery.Dataset(dataset_id)
dataset.location = "US"

try:
    client.create_dataset(dataset)
    print(f"✅ Created dataset {dataset_id}")
except:
    print(f"⚠ Dataset {dataset_id} already exists")
```

### **3. Train a Model with BQML**
   We’ll train a linear regression model that predicts temperature (temp) based on the day of year and year.

```python
train_query = """
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `weather_ml.hanoi_temp_model`
OPTIONS (
    model_type='linear_reg',
    input_label_cols=['y']
) AS
SELECT
  EXTRACT(DAYOFYEAR FROM DATE(CAST(year AS INT64), CAST(mo AS INT64), CAST(da AS INT64))) AS day_of_year,
  CAST(year AS INT64) AS year_num,
  temp AS y
FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*`
WHERE stn = '488200'
  AND _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '2020' AND '2022'
  AND temp IS NOT NULL AND temp != 9999.9
"""

client.query(train_query).result()
print("✅ Model trained in BigQuery")
```

### **4. Evaluate the Model**





```

```python
```python
eval_query = """
SELECT
  *
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL `weather_ml.hanoi_temp_model`,
    (
      SELECT
        EXTRACT(DAYOFYEAR FROM DATE(CAST(year AS INT64), CAST(mo AS INT64), CAST(da AS INT64))) AS day_of_year,
        CAST(year AS INT64) AS year_num,
        temp AS y
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*`
      WHERE stn = '488200'
        AND _TABLE_SUFFIX = '2022'
        AND temp IS NOT NULL AND temp != 9999.9
    )
  )
"""

evaluation = client.query(eval_query).to_dataframe()
print(evaluation)
```
```

### **5. Predict Future Temperatures**

For example, predict for the first 30 days of 2023:

```python
predict_query = """
SELECT
  day_of_year,
  year_num,
  predicted_y
FROM
  ML.PREDICT(MODEL `weather_ml.hanoi_temp_model`,
    (
      SELECT
        day_of_year,
        2023 AS year_num
      FROM UNNEST(GENERATE_ARRAY(1, 30)) AS day_of_year
    )
  )
"""

predictions = client.query(predict_query).to_dataframe()
print(predictions)
```

### **3. BigQuery Generative AI (`AI.FORECAST`)**

* Use **Google Cloud’s AI.FORECAST** function for server-side time-series forecasting.
* No manual feature engineering or model tuning – just provide your dataset and forecast horizon.
* Ideal for **fast prototyping** and large datasets.

### **Approach 3 – Using AI.FORECAST**

```python
from google.cloud import bigquery

client = bigquery.Client()

query_forecast = """
SELECT *
FROM AI.FORECAST(
  MODEL(
    SELECT
      DATE(CAST(year AS INT64), CAST(mo AS INT64), CAST(da AS INT64)) AS ds,
      temp AS y
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.noaa_gsod.gsod*`
    WHERE stn = '488200'
      AND _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '2020' AND '2022'
      AND temp IS NOT NULL AND temp != 9999.9
    ORDER BY ds
  ),
  STRUCT(
    30 AS horizon,         -- Forecast 30 days ahead
    0.8 AS confidence_level
  )
)
"""

forecast_df = client.query(query_forecast).to_dataframe(create_bqstorage_client=False)
print(forecast_df.head())
```
