## Features

- Created 14-channel map features and 16-channel scalar features.
- Normalized these features to the range of -1 to 1, except for some exceptions.
- Standardized normalization criteria (e.g., `OWN_UNIT_ENERGY` and `UNIT_MOVE_COST` both represent energy values and were normalized using a common scale).
- Applied mirroring so that the initial position of the home team is always (0,0).

### Map Features (14 channels)

## Estimation of Hidden States

Unknown environmental parameters and hidden states, which vary randomly per match, were estimated using the following methods:

- **`NEXT_TILE_TYPE`**
    - Estimated tile drift speed from observed tile movements and predicted the next tile state accordingly.
- **`ENERGY`**
    - Estimate the overall energy map by narrowing down the energy nodes from the partially observed energy map by a Exhaustive search
- **`POINTS`**
    - Estimate point probabilities by Bayesian inference.
    - Initialized relic-adjacent tiles with 0.5 and others with 0.0.
- **`OPP_UNIT_COUNT`**
    - Track all possible actions of previously observed enemy units to estimate their existence probabilities.
- **`NEBULA_TILE_VISION_REDUCTION`**
    - Estimated based on observed unit vision changes when stepping on nebula tiles.
- **`ENERGY_NODE_DRIFT_SPEED`**
    - Prepared candidate drift speeds and refined estimates using Bayesian inference.
- **`NEBULA_TILE_ENERGY_REDUCTION`**
    - Estimated from observed unit energy reductions when stepping on nebula tiles.
- **`UNIT_SAP_DROPOFF_FACTOR`**
    - Estimated based on observed energy values of adjacent enemy units.

## Model Architecture

- Based on the 6th place LuxAI Season 1 solution using a UNet architecture ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lux-ai-2021/discussion/293776)).
- **Inputs**
    - Map features `(14, n_stack, 24,24)`
    - Scalar features `(16, n_stack)`
    - `n_stack` is a parameter for how many steps in the past to input the state, we use n_stack=4. This means that the states of the past 4steps are input to the model as features.
- **Outputs**
    - Policy logits `(6,24,24)`
        - `CENTER = 0, UP = 1, RIGHT = 2, DOWN = 3, LEFT = 4, SAP = 5`
    - SAP policy logits `(1,24,24)`
        - Probability of sap in that cell.
- **Model layers**
    - UNet (encoder/decoder)
    - SAP Policy Layer
        - Predicted SAP policy using a residual convolutional layer.
        - Stabilized training by adding batch normalization in the final layer.
    - Policy Layer
        - Combined SAP policy with UNet decoder output and predicted policy using a residual convolutional layer.

## Training

- loss
    - policy → DiceLoss
    - sap policy → Custom Focal Tversky Loss (weight=0.1)
        - Sap targets are on the (24,24) map (1 if the target team is at the sap location, 0 otherwise)
        - The target was masked so that only `SAP_AVAILABLE_AREA` was the training target because the target was sparse, and Focal Tversky Loss was employed to counter sparse targets.
        - Set loss weight is 0.1 not to inhibit policy learning.
- training setting
    - epoch=30
    - lr=1e-3
    - batch_size=1024
- augmentation
    - Applied mirroring along the x and y axes.

## Action Selection

- Predicted two map-based policies using a neural network:
    - **Policy (6, 24, 24)**
        - Actions: `CENTER = 0, UP = 1, RIGHT = 2, DOWN = 3, LEFT = 4, SAP = 5`
        - Applied softmax on valid actions to convert logits into probabilities.
        - Sampled actions probabilistically like following:
        
        ```python
        action = np.random.choice(range(6), p=policy)
        ```
        
    - **SAP Policy (1, 24, 24)**
        - Predicted SAP probability per cell.
- **Action assignment by minimum cost flow**
    - Units in the same cell tend to take the same action, so actions were assigned using minimum cost flow based on unit policies.
    1. **Assignment of SAP Actions**
        1. Enumerate the units (SAP units) for which a SAP action is sampled at a given step.
        2. For each SAP unit, list the SAP position candidates based on the sap map and the next-best move action after the sap action with its probability. (to avoid unnecessary sap when the sap map value is very small around a unit).
        3. Define cost of target sap point(x,y) as `cost = 1 - sap_policy[y,x] * policy[5]` if it is a sap action, `cost = 1 - policy[action_idx]`otherwise
        4. Assign actions to SAP units by minimizing the total cost using minimum cost flow.
    2. **Assignment of Move Actions**
        1. Enumerate the units (MOVE units) that are not SAP units at a given step.
        2. For each move unit, list all possible actions(without sap) along with their probability values.
        3. Define the cost of each action as `cost = 1 - unit_policy[action_idx]`  and add a penalty cost for moving to an already occupied cell.
        4. Assign actions to MOVE units by minimizing the total cost using minimum cost flow.

- **TTA (Test Time Augmentation)**
    - Applied mirroring along the x and y axes.

## Performance Evaluation

### Visualizer (by streamlit)

- Checked features estimation results.

### Custom Tournament Evaluation

- Modified `luxai_runner` to display win rate and p-value in a tournament setting.
- Conducted a sufficient number of local matches (e.g., 100 episodes) and adopted model changes only if the win rate significantly improved over the best existing model.
