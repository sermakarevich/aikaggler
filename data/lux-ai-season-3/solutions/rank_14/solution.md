# Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning solution for Lux AI NeurIPS 2024 Competition

## Solution
We choose multi-agent RL to tackle the problem. Our primary motivation is to study multi-agent learning behavior and to explore the possibilities of MARL research.

## Early concepts
Our goal is to minimize using hardcoded rules to improve the agents. We are curious to see how well the agents can learn this challenging partially observable environment.
The biggest challenge is that the relic fragments are always hidden from the observation. It can only be observed through points collected at a timestep. The straightforward approach would be to track the points gained and solve the problem mathematically.

#### Experiment with RNN
Instead of using maths, we experiment meta-reinforcement learning algorithm [1]. If the agents remember where they get the points (rewards for meta RL), the agents should learn the exact locations of relic fragments. Our experiment code is based on the xland-minigrid [2]. We give a memory unit with RNN for each agent. The idea is to give each unit the ability to remember past timesteps and learn the optimal strategy.
The observations are fed as 7x7 egocentric information channels and the actions are conditioned on observation embeddings and hidden states of RNN. The model parameters are shared for all the agents. During inference, the observation and memory are unique to each agent.
We observe interesting behavior emerged. For some maps that are hard to find relics, only two or three agents find the relics in the first match. For the following matches, only those agents go to the relic nodes where the other agents are still searching for it.
To address this, we add state observation. In LuxAI, the environment dimensions are fixed, 24x24. So, we can take 24x24 observation instead of concatenating the individual observations which is common in multi-agent RL. That solves the problem of sharing the information across all agents.
We modify the RNN hidden state for state observation only. The idea is to offload the agents the ability to remember. State observation RNN should act as the queen of the hive who remembers what happens.
In theory, we imagine it like Edge of Tomorrow [3] where the Omega remembers how the team gets defeated and comes up with adaptive strategies to beat the opponent team in the following matches. It would be pretty cool if it worked.[4]
The results are not good enough. The agents do not figure out the exact fragment positions. There is a lot of wiggling behavior where agents move a lot in fragment clusters because they do not know the exact reward positions. There is no significant improvement after considerable training time. We hypothesize that agents cannot learn combat behavior when they do not have exact fragment positions. So, whoever moves to the opponent's territory loses because they do not have a clear advantage prediction.

#### Integrating rule-based for the first match
We take an open-source rule-based agent by aDg4b [4]. We use it to play the first match. The idea is to get the fragment positions and feed them starting from match 2 in which the RL agents take over. During training, we feed the ground-truth locations of fragments. That is where we notice significant improvements in mean points collected compared to RNN solutions.
The points mean collected with RNN experiments is max 200 per match where feeding the ground-truth fragments is recorded at 400 points per match.
There is a point where we get to experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters [5]. However, it is no better than the rule-based agent by aDg4b.

## Breakthrough
At this point, I am on the verge of giving up. Failing experiments take a toll on my confidence. We decide to pivot to doing for the sake of learning. We determine to use graph neural network to model the communication structure between agents. We decide that we need to calculate fragment nodes manually this time. After that, we want to run one last time to make sure the code is correct. We no longer use the rule-based agent for match 1. Since this is a test run, we remove state observation and experiment with agent-specific egocentric observations.  We make it 47x47 because the agent is at the center and we want the agent to see everything on the map. State encoder is no longer needed this way. The downside is about 75% of the observation is NULL at any timestep. It is meant to be a test so it does not matter if it performs well or not. It was in the first week of Feb. Then, it miraculously performs well on the leaderboard. The position jumped from 150+ to 11-15 in a day of training.

## Final weeks
We try giving more information and adding more layers to the neural network. I do not pay attention to the reward structure. The reward structure is the total point difference. We find out that the agents did not learn to sacrifice the initial points gained. The other teams demonstrate the ability to ambush the fragment clusters from the fog. Our RL agents never learn that ability. We reason that it may be due to the reward structure. For some of the losing matches, the reward is given higher even though it is losing. e.g., the other team sacrificed for about 20 timesteps, we were leading by  30-50 points and the other team wiped out all the agents and took the lead. From the reward structure, our team was given more rewards despite the loss. We revise the reward structure to weigh more on winning or losing the match. With only less than 20 days left, we cannot explore much.

## Model Architecture
We use multiagent proximal policy optimization [8]. The actor model parameters are shared for all the agents. Each agent needs their own inference with their own observation to get an action. The critic sees both teams. This is because the critic needs to know the complete situation of opponent teams without fog [9]. We share more detail in model_architecture.pdf [10]

## Learning points and future work
#### Performance metrics
We should have implemented all the metrics and monitoring before we start the training. It is not efficient to watch and analyze the replays. The match statistics are needed to see if the agents learn a particular strategy or not. We can track how the behavior evolves over time. I believe we should have every statistics we can think of.

#### Action masking
We have basic action masking. We expect RL agents will learn themselves without strict intervention. This is wrong in our case. We need to mask everything that does not make sense from the beginning. I believe adding action-masking rules that we are confident in is beneficial. e.g., I forget to mask insufficient energy for sapping. They fail to learn that. So, we should not expect that the agents will learn to not do silly actions. It has been studied that action masking improves RL learning a lot [7]. At that point, it is the common wisdom.

#### Model architecture
I am solely responsible for experimenting with different architectures. My modeling skill is subpar. I believe the model architecture is the bottleneck. I try to make it work with vision transformer but in the end, I go with convolution neural network with residual connections. Near the end of the competition, I experiment with vision transformer with CNN teacher model. Vision transformer shows some promise but it is taking a lot longer. With a limited computing budget, it is not feasible.

#### Agent coordination
Since all the agents decide the action themselves, there are weaknesses in attack and defense. One major weakness is we need to use action sampling. If we take maximum likely action, agents are not sapping a lot and the performance is significantly worse than sampling. Agents do not know which agents will be sapping and doing what. I try to solve it with the communication action head but it does not work. In the next season, I would like to explore communication protocols to coordinate actions better, possibly with graph neural networks.

## Conclusion
I like to thank everyone. I like to thank the creators of Lux AI and the supportive community. It has been fun. I wanted to win a prize. It was stressful and challenging. I had fun anyway. I learned a lot. I take this as a failure that helps me grow. I hope I will be mature enough to just participate to have fun and learn new things instead of pushing myself to win.
I like to thank my lifelong mentor @javelin1991 who taught me RL intensively for the past few months. I learn RL a lot faster because of you. In the past months, I have learned how to read research papers, how to ask interesting questions, and how to trace the thinking patterns of researchers. I am glad I got this mentorship. I hope to share what I have learned with anyone who wants to pursue RL.

## Notes
We share the GitHub repository https://github.com/L16H7/lux-3-comets/. I am sorry for the messy code. I will clean the repository when I am available later. For the latest submission, we trained for 15 days straight on a single 4090 GPU, about 30 million update steps. In terms of env steps, the combined total is over 1 billion. We used vast.ai to rent the GPU. The total cost for all experiments is about 500 USD. It is a lot for me right now since I am stretching the dollars. Even though there are a lot of free resources to learn online, we still need to pay for GPU hours to learn. It's the price of knowledge. I am looking for new opportunities and I would appreciate your help. It will mean a lot to me if you give a star on github. Only if you find it useful! Please like and subscribe. 😃
